This package contains Ruby bindings to the LLVM api, enabling users to make use
of LLVM's optimization passes and JIT compilation for implementing compiled
DSLs, callback functions, or fast Ruby method implementations.

ruby-llvm has been tested on the following Ruby interpreters:

* MRI 1.8.7
* MRI 1.9.1
* JRuby 1.4.0

If using MRI, then at least ffi >= 0.5.4 is required.

== Requirements
* LLVM >= 2.6, compiled with SHARED_LIBRARY=1
